Tutorial
*******************
xonsh is shell language and command prompt. Unlike other shells, xonsh is 
based on Python with additional syntax added that makes calling subprocess
commands, manipulating the environment, and dealing with the file system easy. 
The xonsh command prompt give the users interactive access to the xonsh 
language. 

While all Python code is also xonsh, not all BASH code can be used in xonsh.
That would defeat the purpose and Python is better anyway! Still, xonsh is
BASH-wards compatible in the ways that matter, such as for running commands, 
reading in the BASH environment, and utilizing BASH tab completion.

The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you xonsh. There are many excellent
guides out there for learning Python and this will not join their ranks.
Similarly, you'd probably get the most out of this tutorial if you have 
already used a command prompt or interactive interpreter. 

Let's dive in!

Starting xonsh
========================
Assuming you have successfully installed xonsh (see http://xonsh.org),
you can start up the xonsh interpreter via the ``xonsh`` command. Suppose
you are in a lesser terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    bash $ xonsh
    snail@home ~ $

Now we are in a xonsh shell. Our username happens to be ``snail``, our
hostname happens to be ``home``, and we are in our home directory (``~``).
Alternatively, you can setup your terminal emulator (xterm, gnome-terminal, 
etc) to run xonsh automatically when it starts up. This is recommended.

Basics
=======================
The xonsh language is based on Python and the xonsh shell uses Python to 
interpret any input it receives. This makes simple things, like arithmetic, 
simple:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> 1 + 1
    2

.. note:: From here on we'll be using ``>>>`` to prefix (or prompt) any 
          xonsh input. This follows the Python convention and helps trick 
          syntax highlighting, though ``$`` is more traditional for shells.

Since this is just Python, we are able import modules, print values, 
and use other built-in Python functionality:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import sys
    >>> print(sys.version)
    3.4.2 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Oct 21 2014, 17:16:37) 
    [GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)]


We can also create and use literal data types, such as ints, floats, lists,
sets, and dictionaries. Everything that you are used to if you already know 
Python is there:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> d = {'xonsh': True}
    >>> d.get('bash', False)
    False

The xonsh shell also supports multi-line input, for more advanced flow control.
The multi-line mode is automatically entered whenever the first line of input
is not syntactically valid on its own. Multi-line mode is then exited when 
enter (or return) is pressed when the cursor is in the first column.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> if True:
    ...     print(1)
    ... else:
    ...     print(2)
    ...
    1

Flow control, of course, includes loops.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for i, x in enumerate('xonsh'):
    ...     print(i, x)
    ...
    0 x
    1 o
    2 n
    3 s
    4 h

We can also define and call functions and classes. I'll mostly spare you the 
details, but this *is* pretty cool:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> def f():
    ...     return "xonsh"
    ...
    >>> f()
    'xonsh'

And that about wraps it up for the basics section. It is just like Python.

Environment Variables
=======================
Environment variables are written as ``$`` followed by a name.  For example, 
``$HOME``, ``$PWD``, and ``$PATH``. 

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> $HOME
    '/home/snail'

You can set (and export) environment variables like you would set any other 
variable in Python.  The same is true for deleting them too.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> $GOAL = 'Become the Lord of the Files'
    >>> print($GOAL)
    Become the Lord of the Files
    >>> del $GOAL

Very nice. All environment variables live in the built-in 
``__xonsh_env__`` mapping. You can access this mapping directly, but in most 
situations, you shouldn't need to.

Like other variables in Python, environment variables have a type. Sometimes
this type is imposed based on the variable name. The current rules are pretty
simple:

* ``PATH``: any variable whose name contains PATH is a list of strings.
* ``XONSH_HISTORY_SIZE``: this variable is an int.

xonsh will automatically convert back and forth to untyped (string-only)
representations of the environment as needed (mostly by subprocess commands).
When in xonsh, you'll always have the typed version.  Here are a couple of 
PATH examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> $PATH
    ['/home/snail/.local/bin', '/home/snail/sandbox/bin', 
    '/home/snail/miniconda3/bin', '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/sbin', 
    '/usr/bin', '/usr/sbin', '/bin', '/sbin', '.']
    >>> $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ['/home/snail/.local/lib', '']

Also note that *any* Python object can go into the environment. It is sometimes
useful to have more sophisticated types, like functions, in the environment.
There are handful of environment variables that xonsh considers special.
They can be seen in the table below:

================== =========================== ================================
variable           default                     description
================== =========================== ================================
PROMPT             xosh.environ.default_prompt The prompt text, may be str or 
                                               function which returns a str.
MULTILINE_PROMPT   ``'.'``                     Prompt text for 2nd+ lines of
                                               input, may be str or 
                                               function which returns a str.
XONSHRC            ``'~/.xonshrc'``            Location of run control file
XONSH_HISTORY_SIZE 8128                        Number of items to store in the
                                               history.
XONSH_HISTORY_FILE ``'~/.xonsh_history'``      Location of history file
BASH_COMPLETIONS   ``[] or ['/etc/...']``      This is a list of strings that 
                                               specifies where the BASH 
                                               completion files may be found. 
                                               The default values is platform
                                               dependent, but sane.
================== =========================== ================================

Customizing the prompt is probably the most common reason for altering an 
environment variable.

Environment Lookup with ``${}``
================================
The ``$NAME`` is great as long as you know the name of the environment 
variable you want to look up.  But what if you want to construct the name
programatically, or read it from another variable? Enter the ``${}`` 
operator.

.. warning:: In BASH, ``$NAME`` and ``${NAME}`` are syntactically equivalent.
             In xonsh, they have separate meanings.

While in Python-mode (not subprocess-mode, which we'll get to later), we can 
place any valid Python expression inside of the curly braces in ``${<expr>}``. 
This result of this expression will then be used to look up a value in 
the environment.  In fact, ``${<expr>}`` is the same as doing 
``__xonsh_env__[<expr>]``, but much nicer to look at. Here are a couple of 
examples in action:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> x = 'USER'
    >>> ${x}
    'snail'
    >>> ${'HO' + 'ME'}
    '/home/snail'

Not bad, xonsh, not bad.


Running Commands
==============================
As a shell, xonsh is meant to make running commands easy and fun. 
Running subprocess commands should work like any other in any other shell.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> echo "Yoo hoo"
    Yoo hoo
    >>> cd xonsh
    >>> ls
    build  docs     README.rst  setup.py  xonsh           __pycache__
    dist   license  scripts     tests     xonsh.egg-info
    >>> git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   docs/tutorial.rst

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
    >>> exit

This should feel very natural.


Python-mode vs Subprocess-mode
================================
It is sometimes helpful to make the distinction between lines that operate
in pure Python mode and lines that use shell-specific syntax, edit the 
execution environment, and run commands. Unfortunately, it is not always
clear from the syntax alone what mode is desired. This ambiguity stems from
most command line utilities looking a lot like Python operators.

Take the case of ``ls -l``.  This is valid Python code, though it could 
have also been written as ``ls - l`` or ``ls-l``.  So how does xonsh know 
that ``ls -l`` is meant to be run in subprocess-mode?

For any given line that only contains an expression statement (expr-stmt, 
see the Python AST docs for more information), if the left-most name cannot 
be found as a current variable name xonsh will try to parse the line as 
subprocess command instead.  In the above, if ``ls`` is not a variable, 
then subprocess mode will be attempted. If parsing in subprocess mode fails, 
then the line is left in Python-mode.

In the following example, we will list the contents of the directory 
with ``ls -l``. Then we'll make new variable names ``ls`` and ``l`` and then
subtract them. Finally, we will delete ``ls`` and ``l`` and be able to list 
the directories again.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> # this will be in subproc-mode, because ls doesn't exist
    >>> ls -l
    total 0
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 snail snail 0 Mar  8 15:46 xonsh
    >>> # set an ls variable to force python-mode
    >>> ls = 44
    >>> l = 2
    >>> ls -l
    42
    >>> # deleting ls will return us to supbroc-mode
    >>> del ls
    >>> ls -l
    total 0
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 snail snail 0 Mar  8 15:46 xonsh

The determination between Python- and subprocess-modes is always done in the
safest possible way. If anything goes wrong, it will favor Python-mode.
The determination between the two modes is done well ahead of any execution.
You do not need to worry about partially executed commands - that is 
impossible.

If absolutely want to run a subprocess command, you can always force xonsh
to do so with the syntax that we will see in the following sections.


Captured Subprocess with ``$()``
================================
The ``$(<expr>)`` operator in xonsh executes a subprocess command and 
*captures* the output. The expression in the parentheses will be run and 
stdout will be returned as string. This is similar to how ``$()`` performs in 
BASH.  For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> $(ls -l)
    'total 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 snail snail 0 Mar  8 15:46 xonsh\n'

The ``$()`` operator is an expression itself. This means that we can 
assign the results to a variable or perform any other manipulations we want.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> x = $(ls -l)
    >>> print(x.upper())
    TOTAL 0
    -RW-RW-R-- 1 SNAIL SNAIL 0 MAR  8 15:46 XONSH

While in subprocess-mode or inside of a captured subprocess, we can always 
still query the environment with ``$NAME`` variables. 

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> $(echo $HOME)
    '/home/snail\n'

The ``${<expr>}`` operator from above will still execute arbitrary
Python code in subprocess mode. So in that way it is the same as before.  
However, it no longer looks up the results in the environment. Instead, 
the result is appended to the subprocess command list. For this reason, 
the expression should evaluate to a string.  For example, 

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> x = 'xonsh'
    >>> y = 'party'
    >>> $(echo ${x + ' ' + y})
    'xonsh party\n'

If we remove the capturing subprocess, the result will be displayed 
normally:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> echo ${x + ' ' + y}
    xonsh party

Thus, ``${}`` allows us to create complex commands in Python-mode and then 
feed them to a subprocess as needed.


Uncaptured Subprocess with ``$[]``
===================================
Uncaptured subprocess are denoted with the ``$[<expr>]`` operator. They are 
the same as ``$()`` captured subprocesses in almost every way. The only 
difference is that the subprocess's stdout passes directly through xonsh and
to the screen.  The return value of ``$[]`` is always ``None``.  

In the following, we can see that the results of ``$[]`` are automatically
printed and the return value is not a string.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> x = $[ls -l]
    total 0
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 snail snail 0 Mar  8 15:46 xonsh
    >>> x is None
    True

Previously when we automatically entered subprocess-mode, uncaptured
subprocesses were used.  Thus ``ls -l`` and ``$[ls -l]`` are usually 
equivalent.


Nesting Subprocesses
=====================================
Though I am begging you not to abuse this, it is possible to nest all of the
dollar sign operators that we have seen so far.  An instance of ``ls -l``
that is on the wrong side of the border of the absurd is shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> $[$(echo ls) ${'-' + $(echo l).strip()}]
    total 0
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 snail snail 0 Mar  8 15:46 xonsh

With great power, and so forth...


Pipes with ``|``
====================================
In subprocess-mode, xonsh allows you to use the ``|`` character to pipe
together commands as you would in other shells.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> env | uniq | sort | grep PATH
    DATAPATH=/usr/share/MCNPX/v260/Data/
    DEFAULTS_PATH=/usr/share/gconf/awesome-gnome.default.path
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/snail/.local/lib:
    MANDATORY_PATH=/usr/share/gconf/awesome-gnome.mandatory.path
    PATH=/home/snail/.local/bin:/home/snail/sandbox/bin:/usr/local/bin
    XDG_SEAT_PATH=/org/freedesktop/DisplayManager/Seat0
    XDG_SESSION_PATH=/org/freedesktop/DisplayManager/Session0

This is only available in subprocess-mode because ``|`` is otherwise a 
Python operator.
If you are unsure of what pipes are, there are many great references out there.
You should be able to find information on StackOverflow or Google.


Writing Files with ``>``
=====================================
In subprocess-mode, if the second to last element is a greater-than sign
``>`` and the last element evaluates to a string, the output of the 
preceding command will be written to file. If the file already exists, the 
current contents will be erased.  For example, let's write a simple file 
called ``conch.txt`` using ``echo``:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> echo Piggy > conch.txt
    'Piggy\n'
    >>> cat conch.txt 
    Piggy
    
This can be pretty useful.  This does not work in Python-mode, since ``>``
is a valid Python operator.


Appending to Files with ``>>``
=====================================
Following the same syntax as with ``>`` in subprocess-mode, the ``>>``
operator allows us to append to a file rather than overwriting it completely.
If the file doesn't exist, it is created. Let's reuse the ``conch.txt`` 
file from above and add a line.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> echo Ralph >> conch.txt
    'Ralph\n'
    >>> cat conch.txt 
    Piggy
    Ralph

Again, the ``>>`` does not work as shown here in Python-mode, where it takes
on its usual meaning.


Non-blocking with ``&``
====================================
In subprocess-mode, you can make a process no-blocking if the last element on 
a line is an ``&``.  The following shows an example with ``emacs``.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> emacs &
    >>>

Note that the prompt is returned to you afterwards.

String Literals in Subprocess-mode
====================================
Strings can be used to escape special character in subprocess-mode. The 
contents of the string are passed directly to the subprocess command as a 
single argument.  So whenever you are in doubt, or if there is a xonsh syntax
error because of a filename, just wrap the offending portion in a string. 

A common use case for this is files with spaces in their names. This 
detestable practice refuses to die. "No problem!" says xonsh, "I have
strings."  Let's see it go!

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> touch "sp ace"
    >>> ls -l
    total 0
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 snail snail 0 Mar  8 17:50 sp ace
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 snail snail 0 Mar  8 15:46 xonsh

Spaces in filenames, of course, are just the beginning.


Filename Globbing with ``*``
===============================
Filename globbing with the ``*`` character is also allowed in subprocess-mode.
This simply uses Python's glob module under-the-covers.  See there for more
details.  As an example, start with a lovely bunch of xonshs:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> touch xonsh conch konk quanxh
    >>> ls
    conch  konk  quanxh  xonsh
    >>> ls *h
    conch  quanxh  xonsh
    >>> ls *o*
    conch  konk  xonsh

This is not available in Python-mode, because multiplication is pretty 
important.


Regular Expression Filename Globbing with Backticks
=====================================================
If you have ever felt that normal globbing could use some more octane, 
then regex globbing is the tool for you! Any string that uses backticks
(`````) instead of quotes (``'``, ``"``) is interpreted as a regular 
expression to match filenames against.  Like with regular globbing, a 
list of successful matches is returned.  In Python-mode, this is just a
list of strings. In subprocess-mode, each filename becomes its own argument
to the subprocess command.

Let's see a demonstration with some simple filenames:


.. code-block:: bash

    >>> touch a aa aaa aba abba aab aabb abcba
    >>> ls `a(a+|b+)a`
    aaa  aba  abba
    >>> print(`a(a+|b+)a`)
    ['aaa', 'aba', 'abba']
    >>> len(`a(a+|b+)a`)
    3

Other than the regex matching, this functions in the same way as normal 
globbing.
For more information, please see the documentation for the ``re`` module in
the Python standard library.

.. warning:: This backtick syntax has very different from that of BASH.  In
             BASH, backticks means to run a captured subprocess ``$()``.


Help & Superhelp with ``?`` & ``??``
=====================================================
From IPython, xonsh allows you to inspect objects with question marks.
A single question mark (``?``) is used to display normal level of help.
Double question marks (``??``) are used to display higher level of help, 
called superhelp. Superhelp usually includes source code if the object was
written in pure Python.  

Let's start by looking at the help for the int type:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> int?
    Type:            type
    String form:     <class 'int'>
    Init definition: (self, *args, **kwargs)
    Docstring:
    int(x=0) -> integer
    int(x, base=10) -> integer

    Convert a number or string to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments
    are given.  If x is a number, return x.__int__().  For floating point
    numbers, this truncates towards zero.

    If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,
    bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in the
    given base.  The literal can be preceded by '+' or '-' and be surrounded
    by whitespace.  The base defaults to 10.  Valid bases are 0 and 2-36.
    Base 0 means to interpret the base from the string as an integer literal.
    >>> int('0b100', base=0)
    4
    <class 'int'>

Now, let's look at the superhelp for the xonsh built-in that enables
regex globbing:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> __xonsh_regexpath__??
    Type:        function
    String form: <function regexpath at 0x7fef91612950>
    File:        /home/scopatz/.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/xonsh-0.1-py3.4.egg/xonsh/built_ins.py
    Definition:  (s)
    Source:
    def regexpath(s):
        """Takes a regular expression string and returns a list of file
        paths that match the regex.
        """
        s = expand_path(s)
        return reglob(s)
    <function regexpath at 0x7fef91612950>

Note that both help and superhelp return the object that they are inspecting.
This allows you to chain together help inside of other operations and 
ask for help several times in an object hierarchy.  For instance, let's get
help for both the dict type and its key() method simultaneously:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dict?.keys??
    Type:            type
    String form:     <class 'dict'>
    Init definition: (self, *args, **kwargs)
    Docstring:
    dict() -> new empty dictionary
    dict(mapping) -> new dictionary initialized from a mapping object's
        (key, value) pairs
    dict(iterable) -> new dictionary initialized as if via:
        d = {}
        for k, v in iterable:
            d[k] = v
    dict(**kwargs) -> new dictionary initialized with the name=value pairs
        in the keyword argument list.  For example:  dict(one=1, two=2)
    Type:        method_descriptor
    String form: <method 'keys' of 'dict' objects>
    Docstring:   D.keys() -> a set-like object providing a view on D's keys
    <method 'keys' of 'dict' objects>

Of course, for subprocess commands, you still want to use the ``man`` command.


Compile, Evaluate, & Execute
================================
Like Python and BASH, xonsh provides built-in hooks to compile, evaluate,
and execute strings of xonsh code.  To prevent this functionality from having
serious name collisions with the Python built-in ``compile()``, ``eval()``,
and ``exec()`` functions, the xonsh equivalents all append an 'x'.  So for
xonsh code you want to use the ``compilex()``, ``evalx()``, and ``execx()`` 
functions. If you don't know what these do, you probably don't need them.


Aliases
==============================
Another important xonsh built-in is the ``aliases`` mapping.  This is 
like a dictionary that effects how subprocess commands are run.  If you are 
familiar with the BASH ``alias`` built-in, this is similar.  Alias command
matching only occurs for the first element of a subprocess command.

The keys of ``aliases`` are strings that act as commands in subprocess-mode.
The meaning the values changes based on the type of the value. If the value
of the alias dictionary is also a string, it is evaluated using ``evalx()``.
This allow you to use arbitrary xonsh code as a command.  While this is
powerful, it is not normally what you want.

If an ``aliases`` value is a list of strings, it is used to replace the 
key in the subprocess command.  For example, here are some of the default
aliases that follow this pattern:

.. code-block:: python

    DEFAULT_ALIASES = {
        'ls': ['ls', '--color=auto', '-v'],
        'grep': ['grep', '--color=auto'],
        'scp-resume': ['rsync', '--partial', '-h', '--progress', '--rsh=ssh'],
        'ipynb': ['ipython', 'notebook', '--no-browser'],
        }

Note that this format forces the aliaser to tokenize the replacement 
themselves. This makes the list-of-strings the safest pattern.  If you really
want to write your alias as a string, use the ``shlex.split()`` function in
the Python standard library.

Lastly, if an alias value is a function (or other callable), then this 
function is called *instead* of going to a subprocess command. Such functions
must have the following signature:

.. code-block:: python

    def mycmd(args, stdin=None):
        """args will be a list of strings representing the arguments to this 
        command. stdin will be a string, if present. This is used to pipe
        the output of the previous command into this one.
        """
        # do whatever you want! Anything you print to stdout or stderr 
        # will be captured for you automatically. This allows callable 
        # aliases to support piping.
        print('I go to stdout and will be printed or piped')

        # Note: that you have access to the xonsh
        # built-ins if you 'import builtins'.  For example, if you need the
        # environment, you could do to following:
        import bulitins
        env = builtins.__xonsh_env__

        # The return value of the function can either be None,
        return

        # a single string representing stdout
        return  'I am out of here'

        # or you can build up strings for stdout and stderr and then   
        # return a (stdout, stderr) tuple. Both of these may be
        # either a str or None. Any results returned like this will be 
        # concatenated with the strings printed elsewhere in the function.
        stdout = 'I commanded'
        stderr = None
        return stdout, stderr

We can dynamically alter the aliases present simply by modifying the 
built-in mapping.  Here is an example using a function value:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> aliases['banana'] = lambda args, stdin=None: ('My spoon is tooo big!', None)
    >>> banana 
    'My spoon is tooo big!'

Aliasing is a powerful way that xonsh allows you to seamless interact to
with Python and subprocess. 


Up, Down, Tab
==============
The up and down keys search history matching from the start of the line, 
much like they do in the IPython shell.

Tab completion is present as well. In Python-mode you are able to complete
based on the variable names in the current builtins, globals, and locals, 
as well as xonsh languages keywords & operator, files & directories, and 
environment variable names. In subprocess-mode, you additionally complete
on any file names on your ``$PATH``, alias keys, and full BASH completion 
for the commands themselves.


That's All, Folks
======================
To leave xonsh, hit ``Crtl-D``, type ``EOF``, or type ``exit``.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> exit

Now it is your turn.
