Run Control File
=========================
Xonsh allows you to have a run control file in your home directory called ``~/.xonshrc``.
This file is written in the xonsh language, of course. It is executed exactly once
at startup. The following is a real-world example of such a file.

:download:`Download xonshrc <xonshrc.xsh>`

    :code: xonsh
